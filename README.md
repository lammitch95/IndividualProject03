Description and Goal:

In this project, you will practice using animation, drag and drop, intents, dialogs, persistent data, and data visualization. Develop your own Kotlin solution for the following problem.

Problem:

Educational games that teach kids basic programming concepts are becoming increasingly popular. For example, see Kodable ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg3GTzgFUPA&ab_channel=Kodable).

Your task is to create an educational game similar to Kodable. You should implement features for creating kids' and parents' accounts. Each player should have a log/history that tracks their progress and performance. A child's performance should only be visible to their parents.

Your game should include at least two different levels of difficulty. Each level must feature a minimum of 3 games, each with an animated user interface.

Complete the Following Requirements:

Create a storyboard for your proposed app.
Collect resources for the assignment, such as images and audio.
Create registration and login features for parents and kids accounts.
Design two different levels, each with 3 games.
Include at least three commands in each game, such as move-up, move-down, etc.
Implement audio playback.
Feature drag and drop functionality.
Handle success and reattempt scenarios.
Include buttons to start and exit the game.
Log progress in a file.
